# Auction Website Backend

Auction Website backend

Hello, i use Spring on the backend side of this project. I preffered postgresql for a database. I developed the project in monolithic architecture.

On authentication side, user subscription, login and logout features are fully active. I used JWT for authentication.

Users who are not logged in and do not have the required token are redicted to the login page.

I've added a "New Auction" button to the homepage so members can be pu up for auctioning new items. Users will be able to submit new items to the auction by filling in the necessary information thanks to the panel here.

When the bid button on the main page is pressed, you are directed to a page where you can bid for the desired product.
