# Auction Website Backend

Auction Website Backend

Hello, I used Spring on the backend side of this project and preferred PostgreSQL as the database. I developed the project using a monolithic architecture.

On the authentication side, user subscription, login, and logout features are fully functional. I used JWT for authentication.

Users who are not logged in and do not have the required token are redirected to the login page.

I have added a "New Auction" button to the homepage so that members can put up new items for auction. Users will be able to submit new items to the auction by filling in the necessary information on the panel.

When the "Offer" button on the main page is pressed, you are directed to a page where you can bid for the desired product.

On the bid page, you can see the previous bidders for the current item.
